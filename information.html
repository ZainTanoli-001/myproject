                    <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;"> Mountaineering hazards are the inherent dangers that climbers face in the high-altitude environment. These risks can range from natural occurrences like avalanches and rockfall to weather-related challenges like storms and extreme temperatures.

                    <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;">
                        Rockfall and icefall are significant hazards encountered in mountainous terrain during mountaineering expeditions. Rockfall refers to the sudden descent of rocks or boulders from steep cliffs or rock faces. These falls can be triggered by natural processes such as weathering, erosion, or seismic activity, as well as by human activities or changes in temperature. Rockfall poses a serious threat to climbers below, as the rocks can strike with high velocity, causing injuries or even fatalities.</p>
                     
                       <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;">Icefall, on the other hand, occurs in glaciated areas where ice formations, such as seracs or ice cliffs, can collapse or break off unexpectedly. These icefalls can create hazardous conditions for mountaineers navigating through glacier routes, as large chunks of ice can tumble down with tremendous force. Icefall hazards are heightened during periods of warming temperatures or seismic events that destabilize ice formations.</p>
                       
                       <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;">Both rockfall and icefall require mountaineers to exercise caution and awareness of their surroundings, as these hazards can occur without warning. Proper planning, route assessment, and adherence to safety protocols such as wearing helmets and maintaining safe distances from potential fall zones are essential to mitigate the risks associated with rockfall and icefall during mountaineering expeditions.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;"> Deep cracks in glaciers can be hidden by snow and pose a significant risk of talling.They form when the ice moves at different speeds, causing the ice to break apart. Crevasses can be very dangerous for mountaineers, as they can be hidden by snow or ice and can be very difficult to cross.

                       <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;"> Crevasses form due to the movement of glaciers. As glaciers flow downhill, they encounter obstacles like rocks or changes in terrain. This causes the ice to stretch and break, creating deep cracks.</p>
                       
                    <span style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight:bold; font-family:PP; letter-spacing:0.1vw ;">Hazards:</span>
                     
                       <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;">Crevasses are a serious hazard for mountaineers. They can be very deep, sometimes hundreds of feet, and can be hidden by snow or ice. Falling into a crevasse can be fatal.</p>
                    
                    <span style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight:bold; font-family:PP; letter-spacing:0.1vw ;">Safety:</span>
                     
                       <p style="font-size: 1vw; font-weight: 200;"> To avoid crevasses, mountaineers use ropes and harnesses to stay connected to each other. They also use ice axes and crampons to help them navigate the icy terrain.</p>
